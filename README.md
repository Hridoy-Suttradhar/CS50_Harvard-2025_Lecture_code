# CS50_Harvard-2025_Lecture_code
:books: This repositoy contains my step by step learning from CS50. [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/).

## :memo: Week 1: C Basics 
### Keyword
- Prototype, Parameterization

### :eyes: Topic Covered:
- What is C?
- Function: printf(), get_string().
- Escape Sequences: \n, \r, \\, '\, "\ .
- Data Types: int, strings, chat etc.
- Compiling with 'make', running with './' .
- Contionals > Relational operators > Boolean expression > Loop
- Prototype

### :mag: File History & Learning 
- 

### :brain: Key Learnings
- Always include the necessary libraries <br>
- Use 'Make filename' to compile (auto runs clang) <br>
- Understand placeholder: '%s', ;%i', '%c' etc 
- Use condtional to make program take a decision
- Make code more efficient ( e.g 03-agree1.c)
- '==' ensures that something is equal to somnething 
- Think for optimize a code ( e.g 03-agree2.c , use logical or ||)
- When a code repeated over and over, we can use loop for better design
- The initial void means that the function does not return any values. The (void) means that no values are being provided to the function.
- 

### Keyboard shortcut
- Break from a infinite loop by hitting control-C

### question I had

More coming soon as I progress through the course! :computer:
