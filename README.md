# CS50_Harvard-2025_Lecture_code
:books: This repository contains my step by step learning from CS50. [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/).

## :memo: Week 1: C Basics 
### Keyword
- Prototype, Parameterization

### :eyes: Topic Covered:
- What is C?
- Function: printf(), get_string().
- Escape Sequences: \n, \r, \\, '\, "\ .
- Data Types: int, string, char , ***const** etc.
- Compiling with 'make', running with './' .
- Conditionals > Relational operators > Boolean expression > Loop
- Nested loop

### :brain: Key Learnings
- Always include the necessary libraries <br>
- Use 'make filename' to compile (auto runs clang)
- Understand placeholder: '%s', '%i', '%c' etc.
- Use conditionals to make the program take decisions
- Make code more efficient (e.g. 03-agree1.c)
- '==' ensures that something is equal to something 
- Think to optimize code (e.g. 03-agree2.c, use logical or ||)
- When code is repeated over and over, we can use loop for better design
- The initial `void` in a function declaration means that the function does not return any value, while `(void)` in the
parameter list means the function does not accept any parameters.
- 

## :mang: Description of 
- One of C's shortcomings is the ese by which it manages memory.While c provides you immense control over how memory is utilized,programmers have to be very pitfalls of memory management.


### Keyboard shortcut
- Break from an infinite loop by hitting control-C

### Questions I had
- Why is `const` used?

More coming soon as I progress through the course! :computer:
