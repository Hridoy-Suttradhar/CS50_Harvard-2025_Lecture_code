# CS50 Harvard 2025 Lecture Code
:books: This repository contains my step-by-step learning from CS50. [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/).

## üìù Week 1: C Basics
### Keywords
- Prototype
- Parameterization
- Truncation

### üëÄ Topics Covered:
- What is C?
- Functions: `printf()`, `get_string()`
- Escape Sequences: `\n`, `\r`, `\\`, `\'`, `\"`
- Data Types: `int`, `string`, `char`, `const`, etc.
- Compiling with `make`, running with `./`
- Conditionals > Relational operators > Boolean expressions > Loops
- Nested loops

### üß† Key Learnings
- Always include the necessary libraries
- Use `make filename` to compile (auto runs clang)
- Understand placeholders: `%s`, `%i`, `%c`, etc.
- Use conditionals to make the program take decisions
- Make code more efficient (e.g., `03-agree1.c`)
- `==` ensures that something is equal to something
- Think to optimize code (e.g., `03-agree2.c`, use logical OR `||`)
- When code is repeated over and over, use loops for better design
- The initial `void` in a function declaration means that the function does not return any value, while `(void)` in the parameter list means the function does not accept any parameters.
- Truncation Message: As you are coding, pay special attention to the types of variables you are using to avoid problems within your code.

## üìù Description
- One of C's shortcomings is the ease with which it manages memory. While C provides you immense control over how memory is utilized, programmers have to be wary of the pitfalls of memory management.
- An integer divided by an integer will always result in an integer in C.

### Keyboard Shortcut
- Break from an infinite loop by hitting `Ctrl+C`

### Questions I Had
- Why is `const` used?
- How to evaluate code on three axes: correctness, design, and style

More coming soon as I progress through the course! üíª
