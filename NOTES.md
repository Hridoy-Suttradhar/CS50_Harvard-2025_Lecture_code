### üëÄ Topics Covered:
- What is C?
- Functions: `printf()`, `get_string()`
- Escape Sequences: `\n`, `\r`, `\\`, `\'`, `\"`
- Data Types: `int`, `string`, `char`, `const`, etc.
- Compiling with `make`, running with `./`
- Conditionals > Relational operators > Boolean expressions > Loops
- Nested loops

### üìù Description
- One of C's shortcomings is the ease with which it manages memory. While C provides you immense control over how memory is utilized, programmers have to be wary of the pitfalls of memory management.
- An integer divided by an integer will always result in an integer in C.

### Keyboard Shortcut
- Break from an infinite loop by hitting `Ctrl+C`

### Questions I Had
- Why is `const` used?
- How to evaluate code on three axes: correctness, design, and style
